![image](/images/donmeon3.jpg)

Don Meon who is an international worship leader, songwriter and music executive also runs a ministry known as Worship In Action. Don believes that worship is more than the songs we sing. Worship is sharing God’s love in practical and tangible ways by putting our faith into action.
He also has a charity home where less privileged children are taken care of. The charity home is known as The Royal Seed Home which is a registered charity in Ofaakor, Ghana, that cares for nearly 300 children. For 17 years, Don and the Worship in Action Partners have faithfully supported the Royal Seed Home’s monthly needs by providing food, shelter and a loving family. They never turn away a child in need, and help each one grow into an independent, contributing member of their community. Scripture says, children are precious gifts from God.
